# K6 Testing

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the test

To run a test written in TypeScript, we first have to transpile the TypeScript code into JavaScript running a bundler. 
This project uses `Babel` and `Webpack` to bundle the different files into ES modules (ESM), using its [`webpack.config.js`](./webpack.config.js) configuration.

The next command transforms each TypeScript test in `./src` to the `./dist` folder as ES modules.

```bash
npm run bundle
```

Once that is done, we can run our script the same way we usually do, for instance:

```bash
k6 run dist/get-200-status-test.js
```
